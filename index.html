              My bio is a perpetual work in progress, but I like most things
              technology. I tend to spend a bit too much time optimizing my
              personal dev setup and dotfiles, as well as trying out new
              operating systems.

              Outside of work and side projects, I love animals and I tend to
              enjoy working on my car or skiing if it's the right season.

            I happened upon a pet turtle and I wanted an easier way to check in
            on him when I'm not around, but the camera app I use is a bit
            clunky. So I made a website to live stream his antics for my own
            viewing, and for my friends when they're bored. (Be warned, turtles
            really don't do a lot...)
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm working on a way to have this more widely accessible, but the
            internet is a scary place to have a feed of your turtle for anyone
            to see. For now, you have to know me to have access.

            I like to self-host things! It sprung from me wanting to learn more
            about networking and rolling OpenWRT on my router, and then I
            wondered if I could host a server. Now I host multiple with various
            useful technologies such as:

        <h2>Q&A</h2>

        <div class="qna-item">
          <h3>What kind of work do you enjoy?</h3>
          <p>
            I like learning new technologies in general, but I tend to enjoy
            working on extensible backends and system design, with a bit of
            infrastructure as I get to learn how things really work inside.

        <div class="qna-item">
          <h3>Why is your LinkedIn empty?</h3>
          <p>
            Good question. Turns out LinkedIn really respects data privacy (+1)
            so when I deactivated it a couple years ago, all my data was wiped.
            And well, I don't have much of an interest in what gets posted on
            there anyways. If you want to keep in touch, feel free to email me
            or ask me for my Discord handle.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="qna-item">
          <h3>What are you currently learning or working on?</h3>
          <p>
            I'm loosely trying to learn more about IoT automation, and after not
            loving home assistant, I'm trying to work on an OSS repo I worked
            called Kasa-Nice to have a barebones dashboard to handle my home
            devices. Turns out turtle care requires a lot of timing with respect
            to heaters and lighting.
